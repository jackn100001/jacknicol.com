Welcome visitor, I am Jack.

I'm a young and ambitious web developer with over 2 years of web development experience under my belt. I also have an interest in cyber security and hope to someday pursue a career on the red or blue team (or both).

My weapons of choice are PHP/Laravel for backend, MySQL for databases, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery for frontend.
