Welcome visitor, I am Jack.

I built this site as a bit of fun and to showcase some of my skills. Note that it is still a work in progress, with many updates planned.

A little about me: I am a keen and ambitious web developer with over 2 years of web development experience under my belt. I also have an interest in cyber security and hope to someday pursue a career in the field.

My weapons of choice are PHP/Laravel for backend, MySQL for databases, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery for frontend. I also know some Python.

I enjoy coding, gaming, building websites and learning about cybersecurity.
